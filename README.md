# ML_PM2.5_Prediction
## Introduction
This is my self-learning of the course Machine Learning 2019(Spring) in NTU. The instructor of this course is Hung-yi Lee. This is the homework 1. Check the website of the course: [Machine Learning 2019(Spring)](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses_ML19.html)
## Our Main Goal 
The main goal of this homework is to practice how to implement the **Regression Model** to solve the problem.
## Train Data
In the train.csv, we have the real observation data from a weather station. What we have now is 18 features observed per hour in a day, and we only have 20 days of observation datas in each month. In total, we have 12x20x24 = 5760 sets of raw data. 
### Reorganize The RawData
